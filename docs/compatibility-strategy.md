# Postman Skill Backward Compatibility Strategy

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Version**: v2.0 Modernization Plan
**Target Audience**: Development Team, Users

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the backward compatibility strategy for the Postman Agent Skill v2.0 modernization. It addresses how the skill will handle both v9 and v10+ Postman APIs, migration paths for existing users, and the deprecation timeline for legacy features.

### Strategic Decision

**Approach**: **v10+-First with Graceful Degradation**

- Primary focus on v10+ API compliance
- Maintain existing v9 functionality where possible
- No active v9 testing or v9-specific features
- Let v9 compatibility be incidental, not guaranteed
- Clear communication about v10+ requirements

**Rationale**:
1. Most Postman users are on current versions (v10+)
2. Maintaining dual compatibility increases complexity 2-3x
3. v9 API is deprecated/legacy
4. Development resources are limited
5. New features require v10+ anyway

---

## Compatibility Levels

### Level 1: Full Compatibility (Target)
**API Version**: Postman v10+ (current)
**Support Level**: Full support, testing, documentation
**Features**: All features available

### Level 2: Best Effort (Legacy)
**API Version**: Postman v9 (if still accessible)
**Support Level**: Incidental compatibility, no testing, no guarantees
**Features**: Basic CRUD may work, advanced features unavailable

### Level 3: Not Compatible
**Features**: v10+-only features explicitly not available for v9
- Collection forking/PRs
- Spec Hub
- Enhanced versioning
- New governance features

---

## Version Detection Strategy

### Implementation Approach

The client will detect API version but primarily for logging and informational purposes, not for behavioral changes.

```python
class PostmanClient:
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        self.config = config or PostmanConfig()
        self.config.validate()
        self.retry_handler = RetryHandler(max_retries=self.config.max_retries)
        self.api_version = None  # Detected on first request
        self.api_version_warned = False  # Track if we've warned user

    def _detect_api_version(self, response):
        """
        Detect API version from response.

        This is primarily for logging and user awareness,
        not for behavioral changes.
        """
        # Try header first
        version_header = response.headers.get('X-API-Version')
        if version_header:
            self.api_version = version_header
            return

        # Try to infer from response structure
        try:
            data = response.json()
            # v10+ typically has more metadata
            if self._has_v10_structure(data):
                self.api_version = 'v10+'
            else:
                self.api_version = 'v9-or-earlier'
        except:
            self.api_version = 'unknown'

        # Log version detection
        if self.api_version and not self.api_version.startswith('v10'):
            self._warn_about_old_version()

    def _has_v10_structure(self, data):
        """Check if response has v10+ structure."""
        # v10+ often includes 'meta' fields
        if 'meta' in data:
            return True
        # Check for other v10+ indicators
        # This is heuristic, not definitive
        return False

    def _warn_about_old_version(self):
        """Warn user about using old API version."""
        if not self.api_version_warned:
            import warnings
            warnings.warn(
                f"Detected API version: {self.api_version}. "
                "This skill is optimized for Postman v10+ APIs. "
                "Some features may not work correctly with older versions. "
                "Please upgrade to Postman v10+ for best experience.",
                UserWarning
            )
            self.api_version_warned = True
```

## Breaking Changes

### User-Facing Breaking Changes

None expected for v10+ users. The v2.0 modernization is additive.

### For v9 Users (if any)

If users are still on v9 API:
1. Advanced features won't be available (expected)
2. Basic CRUD operations may work (best effort)
3. No support for v9-specific issues

**Recommendation for v9 users**: Upgrade to Postman v10+ or remain on skill v1.0

---

## Migration Path

### For Current Users (v1.0 → v2.0)

**No migration required** for users on v10+ API.

**Changes**:
- More features available
- Better error messages
- Improved documentation
- Additional capabilities

**Backward Compatible**:
- All existing scripts continue to work
- No API changes to existing methods
- Only additions, no removals

### For v9 Users (if any)

**Option 1: Upgrade Postman (Recommended)**
1. Upgrade to Postman v10+
2. Upgrade to skill v2.0
3. Enjoy all new features

**Option 2: Stay on v1.0**
1. Continue using skill v1.0
2. No new features
3. Basic support only

**Option 3: Use v2.0 with Limitations**
1. Upgrade to skill v2.0
2. Accept that some features won't work
3. Receive warnings about compatibility

---

## Deprecation Timeline

### v1.0 Skill

**Status**: Will be superseded by v2.0
**Timeline**:
- **Now**: v1.0 is current
- **v2.0 Release** (Week 8): v2.0 becomes recommended version
- **Week 8-12**: Dual support (v1.0 and v2.0 both available)
- **Week 12+**: v1.0 deprecated, v2.0 is primary

**Support**:
- v1.0 code remains available
- No active development on v1.0
- Security fixes only for v1.0

### v9 API Support

**Status**: Best effort only
**Timeline**:
- **Now**: No explicit v9 testing
- **v2.0 Release**: v10+ is primary target
- **Future**: If v9 compatibility breaks, will not be fixed

---

## Testing Strategy

### v10+ API (Primary)

**Testing Level**: Comprehensive
- Unit tests for all methods
- Integration tests against live v10+ API
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Performance testing
- Security testing

**Test Environment**:
- Dedicated v10+ test workspace
- Current Postman version
- Latest API endpoints

### v9 API (Legacy)

**Testing Level**: None
- No dedicated v9 testing
- No v9 test environment
- If users report v9 issues, evaluate on case-by-case basis

---

## Error Handling Strategy

### v10+ API

**Approach**: Detailed error handling
- Custom exception types
- Helpful error messages
- Resolution guidance
- Retry logic

### v9 API

**Approach**: Generic error handling
- Generic exceptions
- Basic error messages
- Suggestion to upgrade

**Example**:
```python
def _make_request(self, method, endpoint, **kwargs):
    try:
        response = self.retry_handler.execute(
            lambda: requests.request(method, url, **kwargs)
        )

        # Detect version on first request
        if self.api_version is None:
            self._detect_api_version(response)

        # Handle errors
        if response.status_code >= 400:
            # If we detected old version, suggest upgrade
            if self.api_version and not self.api_version.startswith('v10'):
                error_msg += "\n\nNote: This skill is optimized for Postman v10+ APIs."
                error_msg += "\nPlease upgrade for best compatibility."

            raise self._create_exception(response)

    except Exception as e:
        # Enhanced error context
        raise
```

---

## Documentation Strategy

### User Documentation

**v2.0 Documentation**:
- Assume v10+ API
- Document all features
- v10+ examples
- Clear prerequisites

**v9 Compatibility Notes**:
- Separate "Legacy v9" section
- List unsupported features
- Recommend upgrade path
- Link to v1.0 docs for v9 users

### Code Documentation

**Docstrings**:
```python
def fork_collection(self, collection_uid, label=None, workspace_id=None):
    """
    Create a fork of a collection.

    **Requires**: Postman v10+ API

    Args:
        collection_uid: Collection to fork
        label: Optional label for the fork
        workspace_id: Workspace for the fork

    Returns:
        Forked collection object

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: If v9 API detected
        AuthenticationError: If auth fails

    Note:
        This feature is only available with Postman v10+ APIs.
        If you're on an older version, consider upgrading.
    """
```

        # Existing config...

        # New: Version enforcement
        self.require_v10 = os.getenv("POSTMAN_REQUIRE_V10", "false").lower() == "true"

    def validate(self):
        # Existing validation...

        # Optional: Enforce v10+
        if self.require_v10:
            # Could add check here, but we don't know version until first request
            pass
```
